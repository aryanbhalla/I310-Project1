HALSTEAD COOPERATIVE LABOR PREFERENCE ANALYSIS

Introduction: Halstead Cooperative is a student run cooperative in Austin, Texas. Starting in the 1980s, the cooperartive movement aims to house members of the Austin community into affordable housing, and targeted specifically to students.

In the barest of definitions, members of a cooperative have a private living space, but shared resources (e.g kitchen,movie rooms etc.). A general defining characteristic of cooperative living is that members have to perform a series of chores in order to keep the house functioing. These chores include cooking, cleaning and maintenance. They are usually assigned to members by the labor in charge of the cooperative. The labor in charge takes feedback and availability surveys from all members of the cooperative at the beginning of the semester, then carefully formulates a labor schedule incorporating the responses from all members.

The aim of this project is to analyze which general maintenance shift do members of the cooperative have most availability and preference for on a given weekday, based on data from the Fall 2021 semester.

Data Description: The cooperative has 75 members. Each member was mandatorily made to fill out the form. On the form, they have indicated their preference for the available labor shifts as follows:                   

1)Prefer: Can make the shift

2)Neutral: Indifferent about the shift

3)Dislike: Can, but would prefer to not make the shift

4)Minor Conflict: Has a scheduling conflict at the same time the shift is supposed to take place

5)Blank: No answer means the member cannot make the shift

The labor in charge takes these responses into account and is then tasked with creating a labor schedule manually. They are encouraged, but not required to make a schedule that accomodates every member. For the schedule, there are the following shifts to allot:

1) Morning hobbit: Tasked with cleaning the kitchen and preparing it for the cooking of lunch.

2) Head lunch cook: Tasked with overseeing the cooking of lunch with 2 other members on a given day.

3) Head dinner cook: Tasked with overseeing the cooking of dinner with 3 other members on a given day.

The timings indicated next to the positions are the timings the shifts are supposed to take place. As mentioned earlier, all data collected is for weekdays only.


Problems: Since the data covered is large and some members left slots blank, there might be inconsistencies in the data. Some positions will have an availability more skewed than other positions. This is the result of the erratic nature of the data. Additionally, there is definite bias which is causing the skew of responses. People are indicating their preference for certain positions based on their timings and schedules, which is why some data points have more responses and other have a lot fewer responses. However, there is no bias on the part of the data collector.
